<h1>GDG & DevFest</h1>
<p><strong>Google Developer Groups (GDG)</strong> are local communities of developers interested in Google's developer technologies and platforms. These groups are community-driven and run by volunteers, providing a platform for developers to connect, learn, and build with Google's tools. GDGs host various events, from small gatherings and tech talks to code sprints and hackathons, and form the largest developer community network globally, with over 1,000 communities in more than 145 countries.</p>
<p><strong>DevFest</strong> is an annual, global, and decentralized tech conference series hosted by Google Developer Groups (GDG) communities worldwide. These events are larger than typical meetups and are designed by local organizers to cater to the specific needs and interests of their local developer community. DevFests bring developers together to learn about new products and updates directly from Google product teams, featuring expert-led talks, hands-on workshops, hacking events, networking opportunities, and discussions on various technologies such as AI, cloud, web, mobile development, and machine learning.</p>
